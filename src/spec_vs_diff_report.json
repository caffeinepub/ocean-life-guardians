  "summary": "The implementation provides a functional ocean conservation donation website with React/TypeScript frontend and Motoko backend. Most requirements are implemented, but there are a few critical gaps: REQ-4 acceptance criteria for timestamps and data persistence are not evident in the code, and the generated images are missing from the repository. The ocean-themed design is well-executed with proper color palettes and styling.",
